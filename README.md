### About the app (i.e. what is it doing and why)

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. It's a full-stack site that takes in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with prebuilt user answers. After the user answers the survey question a moal will display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.


### High-level overview of how the app is organized

Friend Finder is deployed to Heroku. It uses express to handle routing which uses api get requests to get the url and then post the results in json format.
